# Add Digits

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: num = 0
Output: 0

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= num <= 231 - 1

 

 **Follow up:**  Could you do it without any loop/recursion in `O(1)` runtime?

        return 0;
      }else{
        return 1+(num-1)%9;
      }
        
    }
}
